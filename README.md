# TLA in L∃∀N4

This project is an embedding TLA in [L∃∀N4](https://lean-lang.org/). The embedding is based on the [coq-tla embedding](https://github.com/tchajed/coq-tla).

As with the original coq embedding, the main goal is a better understanding of the TLA logic.

For the TLA definitions please refer to the seminal paper ["The Temporal
Logic of Actions"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/177492.177726) by [Leslie Lamport](https://www.lamport.org/).
